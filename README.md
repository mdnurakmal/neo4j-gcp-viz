Cloud run has a limit of 32 mb per request

Unable to use default build from app.json because source is in another folder , not in root folder

Unable to pull image directly from dockerhub into cloud run so have to pull from dockerhub first and push to gcp registry first

Cloud run only allows 1 expose port but neo4j requires 2 port
